Recall that the box plot visualises, in particular, the rectangle bound by the lower and upper quartiles: \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_3\\), whereas the coloured line represents the median \\(Q_2\\). We know that \\(Q_2\\) is calculated differently if the sample has even or odd number of elements. By definition, recall, \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_3\\) are medians of the lower half and upper halves of the ordered sample. However, it’s a question of agreement whether to include the median \\(Q_2\\) to both halves or not, in the case when the number of elelements is odd. For example, let the data be \\[\n1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\\] The median is \\(4\\), i.e. \\(Q_2=4\\). Now, we may say that the lower half is \\(1,2,3\\), its median is \\(2\\), i.e. \\(Q_1=2\\), similarly then the upper half is \\(5,6,7\\), hence, \\(Q_3=6\\). Another approach is to say that the lower part is \\(1,2,3,4\\) (including \\(Q_2=4\\)), and it’s median is \\(\\frac{2+3}{2}=2.5\\), i.e. \\(Q_1=2.5\\); similarly then the upper half is \\(4,5,6,7\\), and hence, \\(Q_3=5.5\\). Python in Mathplotlib uses the second approach.\n\n\nHistogram\nLet’s create the histogram for the weights of all sports club members.

There are several ways how to load data to Python.\nIn this lab we consider the first two of them.\nThere are several ways to calculate mean, mode, median, variance and other descriptive characteristics in Python. We will use numpy library for this, so run at the beginning of your Jupyter notebook the following command\nimport numpy as np",

Recall that the box plot visualises, in particular, the rectangle bound by the lower and upper quartiles: \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_3\\), whereas the coloured line represents the median \\(Q_2\\). We know that \\(Q_2\\) is calculated differently if the sample has even or odd number of elements. By definition, recall, \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_3\\) are medians of the lower half and upper halves of the ordered sample. However, it’s a question of agreement whether to include the median \\(Q_2\\) to both halves or not, in the case when the number of elelements is odd. For example, let the data be \\[\n1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\\] The median is \\(4\\), i.e. \\(Q_2=4\\). Now, we may say that the lower half is \\(1,2,3\\), its median is \\(2\\), i.e. \\(Q_1=2\\), similarly then the upper half is \\(5,6,7\\), hence, \\(Q_3=6\\). Another approach is to say that the lower part is \\(1,2,3,4\\) (including \\(Q_2=4\\)), and it’s median is \\(\\frac{2+3}{2}=2.5\\), i.e. \\(Q_1=2.5\\); similarly then the upper half is \\(4,5,6,7\\), and hence, \\(Q_3=5.5\\). Python in Mathplotlib uses the second approach.\n\n\nHistogram\nLet’s create the histogram for the weights of all sports club members. Conside the histogram with \\(20\\) bins.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.hist(b, 20)\nplt.xlabel('Weights')\nplt.ylabel('Counts')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that the change of the number of bins may drastically change the shapce of a histogram, e.g.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.hist(b, 50)                 # 50 bins\nplt.xlabel('Weights')\nplt.ylabel('Counts')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor\n\nplt.hist(b, 5)                 # 5 bins\nplt.xlabel('Weights')\nplt.ylabel('Counts')\nplt.show()",
